It is thus common to use **mean average precision** (MAP) to evaluate retrieval performance on it. Remember from class that MAP adds the precision at the position of each _relevant_ document in a ranked list and then divides by the total number of relevant documents. So that we don't have to scan through the entire collection, we usually evaluate MAP at some maximum rank value, such as 100 or 1000. We simply stop scanning at that maximum rank.\n",
